Hi, this is my project called GPS Compass. 

How should it work? 
  1. When you open the app, you should see two text fields, where you can enter your coordinates. 
  2. Upon entering your coordinates, you can press "Confirm" without getting any error.
  3. Then, an arrow should show up that will lead your way to your destination.

Future plans: 
  - adding altitude (it will display under the arrow)
  - settings for different colours and schemes of arrow
  - maybe distance to the target ??
